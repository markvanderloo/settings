settings
=======

An Option Settings Manager for R.

* See the [package vignette](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/settings/vignettes/settings.html) for examples

Installation
---------------
From R:
```
install.packages('settings')
```

The latest beta is available from my `drat` repo (if your computer is
infected with Windows, you need to install
[rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) first).
```
drat::addRepo("markvanderloo")
install.packages("settings", type="source")
```
